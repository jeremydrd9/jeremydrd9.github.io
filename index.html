     <h2 id="legal-basis">3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On to Process Your Personal Information?</h2>

<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable laws, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

<h3>If You Are Located in the EU or UK</h3>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Contact us to do it.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If You Are Located in Canada</h3>
<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
    <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
    <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
    <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
    <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
    <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
    <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
    <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
    <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>

    <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or another region with laws governing data collection and use, please be aware that your information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. In such cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as relying on Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to protect your personal information.</p>

<p>You can request a copy of these safeguards by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@acne-track.com">contact@acne-track.com</a>. These transfers will always comply with the laws and regulations of the countries from which the data originates, including any additional requirements based on your location.</p>

<h3>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses</h3>

<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice, unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, legal, accounting, or other regulatory purposes).

</div>

        <h2 id="data-security">8. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. These measures are aimed at preventing unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, theft, destruction, or alteration of your data.</p>

<p>However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>

<h3>Our Security Measures</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We encrypt sensitive data to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized personnel have access to personal data.</li>

<div class="highlight">

You should only access the Services within a secure environment. We encourage you to take steps to protect your information, such as using strong passwords and avoiding sharing your account details with others.</p>
</div>

        <h2 id="minors-data">9. Do We Collect Information from Minors?</h2>

<p>Our app is designed for general audiences, and we prioritize the privacy and safety of all users, including minors.</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 where this is restricted by law, such as under the <strong>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> in the United States. If we become aware that personal information has been inadvertently collected from a child under the applicable age of consent in their jurisdiction, we will take immediate steps to delete such data.</p>

<p>Our application does not have an age restriction and can be used by individuals of all ages. However, we encourage parents or guardians to actively supervise and be involved in the online activities and app usage of their children.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> If you believe that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@acne-track.com">contact@acne-track.com</a>, and we will address your concerns promptly.</p>
</div>

        <h2 id="privacy-rights">10. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>

<p><strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

        <h2 id="dnt-controls">11. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications include a <strong>Do-Not-Track ("DNT")</strong> feature or setting that you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.</p>

<p>At this time, no uniform standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been adopted. As a result, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate your choice not to be tracked.</p>

<p>However, if such a standard is adopted in the future, we will update this privacy policy and provide you with details on how we comply with those changes.</p>

<div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> We encourage users to review this policy regularly to stay informed about our practices regarding online tracking.</p>
