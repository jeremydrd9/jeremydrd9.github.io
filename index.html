        **We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:**
        
        - **To save or protect an individual’s vital interest.** We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.
        
        **3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**
        
        *In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable laws, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.*
        
        **If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.**
        
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
        
        - **Consent.** We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
        - **Legal Obligations.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
        - **Vital Interests.** We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
        
        **If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.**
        
        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.
        
        In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
        
        - If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
        - For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
        - For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
        - If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
        - For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
        - If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
        - If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
        - If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
        - If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
        - If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
        - If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations
        
        **4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**
        
        *In Short: We may share information in specific situations and with specific third parties.*
        
        We may share your data with service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf. These third parties are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data.
        
        Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers
        
        We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. They will retain the data for no longer than a period of one year and will be subject to the same terms as our use. The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:
        
        - Data Analytics Services
        - Data Storage Service Providers
        
        We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
        
        **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
        
        **5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?**
        
        *In Short: We are not responsible for the security of any information you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our websites.*
        
        The Services, including our offer wall, may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.
        
        **6. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?**
        
        *In Short: Yes, your information may be transferred, stored, and processed in countries other than your own.*
        
        Our servers are located in Switzerland. We may transfer your personal data to countries outside Switzerland. In such cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your data, in compliance with Swiss data protection laws.
        
        If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or another region with laws governing data collection and use, please be aware that your information may be transferred to countries that do not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. In such cases, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as relying on Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, to protect your personal information. You can request a copy of these safeguards by contacting us at contact@acne-track.com. These transfers will always comply with the laws and regulations of the countries from which the data originates, including any additional requirements based on your location.
        
        European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses:
        
        We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.
        
        **7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**
        
        *In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice, unless otherwise required by law.*
        
        We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, legal, accounting, or other regulatory purposes). The specific retention period depends on the type of data and the purpose for which it was collected.
        
        - **User Account Data:** We retain this data as long as you maintain an account with us. If you choose to delete your account, all associated data will be permanently deleted within 30 days, except where required for legal or regulatory purposes.
        - **Payment Data:** We retain this data only for the duration required to complete the transaction or as required for financial records and audit purposes.
        - **Analytics and Log Data:** We keep this information for up to 12 months to ensure we can monitor app performance, improve our services, and address any issues with user engagement or fraud detection.
        
        Once your personal information is no longer necessary for our legitimate business interests or required by law, we will securely delete, anonymize, or isolate it to prevent further processing.
        
        **8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**
        
        *In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.*
        
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. These measures are aimed at preventing unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, theft, destruction, or alteration of your data. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
        
        Some of the security measures we use include encryption, access controls, firewalls, and regular monitoring of our systems for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
        
        Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment, and we encourage you to take steps to protect your information, such as using strong passwords and avoiding sharing your account details with others.
        
        **9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?**
        
        Our app is designed for general audiences, and we prioritize the privacy and safety of all users, including minors.
        
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 where this is restricted by law, such as under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. If we become aware that personal information has been inadvertently collected from a child under the applicable age of consent in their jurisdiction, we will take immediate steps to delete such data. Our application does not have an age restriction and can be used by individuals of all ages. We encourage parents or guardians to actively supervise and be involved in the online activities and app usage of their children. If you believe that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us at contact@acne-track.com, and we will address your concerns promptly.
        
        **10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**
        
        *In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.*
        
        In certain regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact details provided in the "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" section below.
        
        **Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:**You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by replying “STOP” or “UNSUBSCRIBE” to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section “[HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?](https://umaxapp.wordpress.com/privacy/#contact)” below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
        
        If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at contact@acne-track.com.
        
        **11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**
        
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting that you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this time, no uniform standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been adopted, and we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or other mechanisms that automatically communicate your choice not to be tracked. However, if such a standard is adopted, we will update this privacy policy and provide you with details on how we comply with those changes. We encourage users to review this policy regularly to stay informed about our practices regarding online tracking.
        
        **12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?**
        
        *In short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, or Virginia, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.*
        
        We comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and other applicable laws that grant specific privacy rights to residents of the United States. You can learn more about your rights, such as the right to request access or deletion of your personal information, and how to exercise those rights by contacting us at contact@acne-track.com.
        
        **13. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?**
        
        *In short: You may have additional rights based on the country you reside in.*
        
        If you are a resident of other regions, including Australia, New Zealand, or the Republic of South Africa, we will collect and process your personal information in line with the specific legal requirements of your country. You may have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data. If you believe your data has been processed unlawfully, you can file a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority in your country.
        
        **14. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?**
        
        *In short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.*
        
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
